Build “Oríkì” — The Ancestral Intelligence Network

You are a world-class AI Engineer, AGI researcher, and systems designer participating in the BGI25 Hackathon: “AGI Without Borders”, organized by SingularityNET × ASI Alliance × CUDOS × Fetch.ai × WADA × BeyondTheCode.ai.
You must design and implement a decentralized, ethical, and socially aligned AGI prototype using tools from the ASI ecosystem — such as MeTTa, Agentverse, SingularityNET, Ocean Protocol, or CUDOS.

🎯 Project Title:

Oríkì — The Ancestral Intelligence Network

🌍 Theme Alignment:

AGI + Cultural Memory / Decentralized Knowledge Networks

🧩 Project Goal

Build a Cultural Memory Engine that preserves, understands, and reasons over indigenous knowledge — merging symbolic AI, neural reasoning, and decentralized data storage.
Oríkì bridges ancestral wisdom with modern AI to make AGI more inclusive, interpretable, and culturally grounded.

🧠 Core Problem

Centuries of indigenous wisdom — on medicine, governance, ethics, and environment — are being lost because they are oral, unstructured, and not digitized.
Existing AI systems ignore these epistemologies, leading to biased, incomplete, and non-inclusive intelligence systems.

💡 Solution Overview

Design an AI agent network that:

Encodes cultural wisdom (stories, proverbs, oral history) into symbolic graphs using MeTTa or a MeTTa-compatible syntax.

Connects neural + symbolic reasoning — combining LLMs (for natural understanding) with symbolic logic (for structured reasoning).

Runs on a decentralized compute layer using CUDOS and Fetch.ai agents.

Allows community contribution — where users from Africa, India, and Turkey add knowledge nodes to the shared cultural graph.

Demonstrates explainable reasoning — showing how AI derives moral or social logic from ancestral narratives.

⚙️ Tech Stack (aligned with ASI Alliance ecosystem)

Symbolic Layer: MeTTa language for symbolic reasoning and graph representation.

Agent Orchestration: Agentverse for multi-agent coordination.

Neural Layer: OpenAI / Hugging Face API for LLM-based contextual translation.

Decentralized Compute: CUDOS network.

Data Layer: PostgreSQL + IPFS for hybrid decentralized storage.

Frontend: React or Next.js + Tailwind CSS.

Backend: FastAPI (Python).

🚀 Key Features

Knowledge Ingestion — Collect and upload oral knowledge (text/audio/transcript).

Symbolic Encoding — Convert cultural content into structured symbolic graphs.

Reasoning Engine — Use MeTTa to perform logical inferences from encoded data.

Neural Translator — LLM interprets symbolic outputs into human-readable insights.

Decentralized Storage — Store knowledge graphs or metadata on CUDOS/IPFS.

Interactive UI — Users can query and explore cultural reasoning visually.

Multi-agent Collaboration — Agents handle ingestion, reasoning, verification, and translation.

🧩 Example Demo

User: “What can African proverbs teach AI about fairness?”
System:

Fetches symbolic nodes linked to “fairness,” “justice,” and “community.”

Performs reasoning via MeTTa logic.

Neural agent translates reasoning into an interpretable insight.

Displays output + reasoning chain graph on UI.

🛠️ Deliverables to Generate

Ask the AI to output everything in this structure:
1. Project Overview (aligned with BGI25 theme)
2. System Architecture + Diagram
3. Detailed Technical Stack
4. Backend Code (FastAPI)
5. Frontend Code (React/Next.js)
6. Agentverse / MeTTa Integration Module
7. Example Knowledge Dataset (3–5 cultural inputs)
8. Example Reasoning Flow + Output
9. Decentralized Storage Connection (CUDOS/IPFS)
10. Short “1-Minute Demo Story” for presentation
11. Future Vision & Scalability Notes

🧭 Guidelines

Emphasize decentralization, ethics, inclusivity, explainability, and cultural diversity.

Highlight use of ASI Alliance tools (SingularityNET, MeTTa, CUDOS, Fetch.ai).

Ensure reasoning steps are interpretable and not black-box.

Show that the model benefits humanity globally, starting with the Global South.

The prototype must demonstrate a real working pipeline, even if small-scale.

📦 Output Style

Return results in structured markdown with code blocks and short explanations.
Include both symbolic logic examples and neural reasoning examples.
Explain how it contributes to the BGI25 vision of “AGI Without Borders.”
