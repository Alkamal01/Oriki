# Features Section Redesign - Image-Based

## New Design Concept

The features section will use a modern card layout with:
- **Large hero images** at the top of each card
- **Professional photography** showing real people and scenarios
- **Hover effects** - images zoom slightly, cards lift with shadow
- **Clean typography** below each image
- **Consistent styling** across all 6 features

## Layout
- 3 columns on desktop
- 2 columns on tablet
- 1 column on mobile
- Each card has an image (224px height) + text content

## Fallback
If images aren't provided, the code will show placeholder SVGs with the feature name, so the site still looks professional.

## Next Steps
1. Provide the 6 images (or let me know if you want me to proceed with placeholders)
2. I'll integrate them into the redesigned features section
3. The new design will be modern, professional, and engaging!
